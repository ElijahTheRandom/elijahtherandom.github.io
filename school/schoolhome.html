            <p>The common area of the dorm quickly after moving in became the most used room in our dorm. My roommates and I spend most of our time in the dorm in the common area watching TV, studying, or just talking.</p>
            <p>Our common area commonly recieves other visitors, and I believe it has aided me in an evolved definition of home.</p>

            <p>A defining feature that led me to choose UAH over other schools were the opportunities to learn and research. The University has yet to disappoint in this aspect.</p>
            <p>I have had the opportunity to join the Space Hardware Club and participated in the Two-Month program. I got to build a rover, and I am currently trying to join other SHC teams.</p>

            <p>Easily the most home-defining feature of UAH is the friends I have made. They have shown me other highly motivated people, and they are very passionate about their studies.</p>
            <p>The many friends I get to see daily make UAH's workload seem not so miserable. They have helped me in many ways.</p>
