            <h2>Livingroom</h2>
            <img src="images/IMG_9107.JPEG" class="aimg">
            <p>I have probably spent more time in this room than any other room I have ever been in. The livingroom was a monumental part of my pre-college life.</p>
            <p>My entire family gathers in this room, and the interfamily connections made in there largely define a portion of my defintion of home.</p>

            <h2>Kitchen</h2>
            <img src="images/IMG_9108.JPEG" class ="aimg">
            <p>Easily one of my favorite parts of our house. Food is fantastic, and my family thinks so too. My mother is an old south cook, so despite being a dietitian the food she cooks is largely unhealthy but very homely.</p>

            <img class="aimg" src="images/IMG_6974.jpeg">
            <p>Welcome to the inside of my home! Each room, piece of furniture, and appliance all have a story.</p>

            <h2>My Favorite Picture Inside the House</h2>
            <img class="aimg" src="images/ornamenthead.png">
            <p>I was probably between one and two in this picture, and I just find it hilarious. I dumped the ornaments out so I could put the box on my head.</p>

            <h2>Bedroom</h2>
            <img src="images/IMG_6895.JPEG" class="aimg">
            <p>The picture shown here is post-moveout. My bed used to never be made and the floor is much too empty. However, the photo still shows my random collection of lanyards from school competitions.</p>
            <p>On my bed, there is a quilt displaying many different tennis rackets. My grandma sent the quilt to me for my birthday, and I believe that shows strong family bonds.</p>

        <div class="card">
            <h2>Family</h2>
            <img src="images/family.png" class="aimg">
            <p>Easily the most defining feature of my home is my family. They have shaped my person to be who I am today. From my close family to my extended family, we are very close.</p>
            <p>My father's side of the family meets at his mom's house every Sunday for lunch, and that particular event has allowed me to become inseperably close with many of the members of his side of the family.</p>
