            <h2>Chickens</h2>
            <img src="images/IMG_9066.JPG" class="aimg">
            <p>A beautiful image taken of our pasture with our chickens. As much as I would like, this is not my photo. My dad took this fantastic picture.</p>
            <p>Chickens provide an indespensible resource of food. We have not had to buy eggs in years, and we have eaten more chicken.</p>
            <p>These chickens give my family some indepenence from the market and show our want for self-sufficiency.</p>

            <h2>Garden</h2>
            <img src="images/IMG_2328.JPEG" class ="aimg">
            <p>This garden is my mothers favorite pastime, and it highlights my family's desire for self-sufficiency. We grow all sorts of vegetables, and we can them for use later in the year.</p>

            <h2>Welcome Outdoors</h2>
            <img class="aimg" src="images/top view.png">
            <p>The outside of my house is incredibly lively! Between garden and chickens, it is constantly moving and growing.</p>
            <p>This arial view of my house shows a U shape. This is not signifigant, I just think it is funny.</p>

            <h2>Obligatory Snow Picture</h2>
            <img class="aimg" src="images/IMG_4416.JPG">
            <p>The one time a few years ago when it actually snowed more than a dusting.</p>
            <p>Snow is wonderful.</p>

            <h2>Porch</h2>
            <img src="images/IMG_9109.JPEG" class="aimg">
            <p>Our front porch is a neglected reminder of my family's attempt to make our lives look stable and uniform. We get swept up in the business of life too often to maintain the porch.</p>
            <p>Prime example: this picture was taken after two freezes and our fake furns are still up: mocking the neighbors dead furns with their plastic life.</p>

            <h2>Yard</h2>
            <img src="images/IMG_3251.jpg" class ="aimg">
            <p>The yard was a staple of my childhood. I spent countless hours running around with sticks with my brother and cousins. It was a host for all sorts of imaginary situations.</p>
            <p>More recently, the yard has become a host to our many plants and animals. We have apple trees, blueberry bushes, and grape vines.</p>
