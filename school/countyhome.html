            <p>My Alma Mater and a defining piece of my home. I spent hundreds of hours in this school learning, making friends, and defining my future.</p>
            <p>Loretto High School has supplied me with knowledge and skills that have made me a more thourough and committed person. I believe this school has given me drive to make me be the best I can possibly be.</p>

            <p>I have always lived in Leoma. I went to elementary school here, went to church here, and have learned many life lessons here.</p>
            <p>A rural unincorporated community, Leoma has shown me many examples of burnout and defeated adults. As sad as it may be, it has pushed me to go beyond the community.</p>
            <p>But between the world-worn adults, the community has taught me many life lessons and has defined itself as part of my home.</p>

            <p>More commonly known by everyone in the area as "Town", Lawrenceburg was my first "big" city. Loretto was small and Leoma was even smaller, so the highway town with it's 5 Mexican resturaunts has been a monumental place in my life.</p>
            <p>I have spent countless hours in Crockett Park in Lawrenceburg learning about nature and getaways. I also learned to code in Lawrenceburg, sparking my dreams of being a Computer Scientist.</p>
            <p>As boring as Lawrenceburg may seem to outsiders, it played a central role in my upbringing.</p>

            <p>In my mind, there are 5 things in Loretto: A High School, A Catholic Church, A Sonic, A Hardees, and A Burger King</p>
            <p>That does not seem like much, but the High School makes up for the lack of anything else. </p>
